Data Quality
============

Generally speaking, the data provided by ENTSO-E should be taken with a grain
of salt.

Sometimes historic data is revised so that the same data set may contain
different values, depending on the download date.  It can happen, though, that
data older than two years is removed during such a revision.

The "MessageDateTime" XML tag seems to contain the date on which the data was
released by entsoe.net.
