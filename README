Cross-Border Schedules
======================

"Day Ahead Crossborder Schedules"

Day Ahead schedules are scheduled energy exchanges between control blocks for
the next day.  The day starts at midnight and finishes next midnight. The
values are in MW for average flow over the hour. Thoses values are available
for the next day after 22h00 UTC.

FAQ:  D-1 Cross-Border Commecial Schedules are previsions for the next full
day (available during evening).

FAQ:  Schedules are available the day before, as a prevision, and physical
flows are "real-time" data.


Cross-Border Physical Flows
===========================

"Physical Crossborder Flow"

FAQ:  Cross-Border Physical flows are the "live" data, provided hour after
hour during the day.


Final Cross-Border Schedules
============================

Final schedules are the refined Physical Flows.

FAQ:  Final Cross-Border Schedules are controlled schedules data provided with
one week delay.


Planned schedule evolution
==========================

The Planned Schedule Evolution provides the evolution of the day ahead
schedule after each nomination gate.  During the day and after the daily
allocation process, capacity is nominated by market players at different
nomination gate closures, this is known as nomination gate. However, the
allocation process can be performed continuously. Market rules fix the number
of nomination gates available to market players for a given interconnection.


Comparison Physical Flow vs Final Schedules
===========================================

The ETSOVista platform presents cross border physical flows and final
schedules based on country views. In certain countries there are profiles for
a regional NTC view with values involving several borders. Considering this
approach, the ETSOVista platform includes profiles to compare Physical Flows
vs. Final Schedules.
